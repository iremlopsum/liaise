# Migration Guide

Upgrade notes for `liaise` (published as `@iremlopsum/apify` up to 4.4.x). Only releases that need action appear
here — if a version isn't listed, upgrading to it requires no changes.

For the full record of what changed in each release, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Upgrading to 5.0.3

No action needed. Documentation only, plus corrected type comments in `src/types.ts`.

---

## Upgrading to 5.0.2

No code changes needed. A call whose path parameter is `undefined`, `null`, an
empty string, an object, an array, a `Date`, a function, a symbol, `NaN` or `Infinity` now returns an
error Result instead of being sent to a URL like `/users/undefined`. Those calls
were already hitting the wrong URL; now they say so. If you relied on a literal
`null` or `undefined` segment, pass the string (`'null'`) explicitly.

---

## Upgrading to 5.0.1

No code changes for most callers. Six things you may observe.

**Binary bodies arrive as binary.** A `Uint8Array`, other typed array, `DataView`
or `Buffer` used to be sent as a JSON index map (`{"0":1,"1":2}`); it is now the
raw bytes, with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`. A `ReadableStream` is
sent as a streaming upload and can be sent once: `retryMiddleware` and
`result.retry()` return an error Result for it. If a call with a stream may be
retried, read it into a `Blob` or `ArrayBuffer` first. If your server decoded the
old index map, it needs to read bytes now.

**Calls that used to send nothing now send, or fail with a Result.** A `Map` with
string keys and a class with only `toJSON()` are now sent. A `Set`, a bare `Date`,
a `Map` with non-string keys and a class with no fields return an error Result
(`kind: 'network'`, `body` a `TypeError` naming the type). A typed array, stream
or `toJSON`-only class on a GET is refused. If you were relying on the empty body,
pass the object you meant: `{ ids: [...set] }`, `{ since: date.toISOString() }`.

**`cacheMiddleware` entries are per URL and per header set.** The key now includes
method, full URL (query string included, pairs sorted by name) and every request
header except `Content-Type`. A different `Authorization` or other header, base
URL, path or query value gets its own entry; the same query params in a different
order share one. A warm cache is cold once after
upgrading. A middleware placed before `cacheMiddleware` that adds a per-call
unique header (a request ID) makes every call a miss; put it after
`cacheMiddleware` in the `middleware` array.

**Repeated header names within one source are joined.** A header-pairs array
with two entries for one name now sends `a, b`, where the last used to win; so
does a record with case-variant duplicates (`{ Accept: 'a', accept: 'b' }`). A
later source (per-call over request over config) still replaces an earlier one.

**After a call settles, a later abort no longer reaches it.** Aborting the
caller's signal no longer reaches that call's `ctx.request.signal`, so
fire-and-forget middleware work still holding it is not cancelled by the caller;
keep your own controller if you need that.

**A path token with non-word characters now fails.** Path tokens are
`[a-zA-Z0-9_]`. A template like `/x/:a-b` with a key `a-b` used to resolve by
accident; it is now read as the token `:a` followed by `-b`, and the call returns
an error Result (a `TypeError`, "Unresolved path parameter :a…"). Use only
`[a-zA-Z0-9_]` in path token names and their keys.

---

## Upgrading to 5.0.0

The package has a new name: **`@iremlopsum/apify` is now `liaise`**. Nothing
else about the API changes — every function, option, type and behaviour is the
same as 4.4.3.

**1. Swap the package.**

```bash
npm uninstall @iremlopsum/apify
npm install liaise
```

**2. Update the import paths** — a find-and-replace across your code:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `@iremlopsum/apify` | `liaise` |
| `@iremlopsum/apify/middleware` | `liaise/middleware` |
| `@iremlopsum/apify/testing` | `liaise/testing` |

Replacing `@iremlopsum/apify` with `liaise` everywhere covers all three.

**One behaviour change, only if you read the logs.** `logMiddleware` and
`cacheMiddleware({ debug: true })` print `[liaise]` and `[liaise cache]` where
they printed `[apify]` and `[apify cache]`. If a log filter, alert or test
matches on the old prefix, update it.

---

## Upgrading to 4.4.3

No code changes. Two things you may observe after upgrading.

**More requests where there were wrongly fewer.** `share: true` endpoints and
`cacheMiddleware` keyed params by their enumerable keys. A `Date`, `Map`, `Set`,
`ArrayBuffer`, BigInt or private-state class instance anywhere below the top
level therefore made every such call look identical, and one caller could
receive the response meant for another caller's params. Those calls now key by
content and go out separately. If request counts rise after upgrading, that is
the fix working: the previous count was wrong responses, not savings. A value
that cannot be keyed soundly (a BigInt, an `ArrayBuffer`, `Blob`, `FormData`
or `URLSearchParams`, an object with no enumerable state) is now never shared
or cached at any depth, where before only the top level was checked.

**`{ a: undefined }` and `{}` are now the same key.** An `undefined` member is
dropped, as `JSON.stringify` drops it on the wire, so equivalent calls hit the
same cache entry and the same in-flight share. There is no way to make
`undefined` mean "a different request", and the wire never carried one.

One smaller change at the top level only: a `Map`, `Set` or `Date` param was
previously never shared or cached; it now is, by content, so two identical such
params coalesce. `FormData`, `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer` and `URLSearchParams` still
never do.

---

## Upgrading to 4.4.2

No action is needed for almost everyone. This release makes `timeout` and
`CallOptions.signal` do what they were documented to do: settle a call even
when a middleware is stuck awaiting work that ignores the signal.

**The rule that changed:** a call is now bounded by its deadline no matter what
it is waiting on. Before, the deadline only reached `fetch` and whatever read
`ctx.request.signal`; anything else could run past it, and the call waited.
So the outcome changes for any call that was still running **after** its
`timeout` fired (or its signal aborted) on work the signal does not reach:

- a middleware awaiting something that never settles — before: the call never
  settled; now: `kind: 'timeout'` / `'abort'`.
- response-side work that crosses the deadline — a middleware post-processing
  a success, an async Standard Schema validator — or a `fetch` implementation
  (a hand-rolled mock, a polyfill) that ignores its signal. Before: the late
  result was delivered; now: `kind: 'timeout'` / `'abort'`, the same as if the
  work had finished one moment later than it did.

A call that finishes within its deadline is unaffected, and so is any work that
already responds to the abort. If you have a test mock that ignores
`init.signal` and resolves *after* a `timeout` you set, that test now sees a
timeout — which is what the configuration asked for.

### If you use `mockFetch` from `./testing`

`mock.fetch` now honours `init.signal`. A mocked call whose signal is aborted —
already, or while its route handler is still pending — rejects with
`signal.reason` instead of resolving, exactly as real `fetch` does. A test that
aborted a call and still expected the mocked response is the only thing this
changes; it now sees the abort.

### If you wrapped calls in your own `Promise.race` against a timer

You can delete the wrapper and use `timeout` (or pass your `AbortSignal`)
instead. A call whose middleware stalls now settles with `kind: 'timeout'` (or
`'abort'`), `status: 0`.

### If a middleware answers an abort slowly

This is the one case above where a middleware's own handling of the deadline
is overruled, so it gets its own section.

Once the signal aborts, the chain gets one macrotask to answer by itself. A
middleware that responds to a timeout by doing *more* I/O before returning its
own `Result` — reading a fallback from IndexedDB, say — used to have that
`Result` delivered, however long it took. Now, if it has not answered within
that macrotask, the caller gets the timeout `Result` and the middleware's later
answer is discarded.

A fallback that answers from memory, or from anything already in hand, is
unaffected — it settles within microtasks. If yours needs real I/O after the
deadline, give it a deadline of its own that fires earlier than the call's:

```ts
const withFallback: Middleware = async (ctx, next) => {
  ctx.request.signal = AbortSignal.timeout(4_000)   // inside the call's 5_000
  const result = await next()
  return result.error?.kind === 'timeout' ? await readFallback(ctx) : result
}
```

Like the per-attempt example in the README, this *replaces* the signal, so the
caller's own `AbortSignal` no longer reaches `fetch` — aborting it still settles
the call (the backstop watches it), but the socket stays open until the 4-second
signal fires. If that matters, merge the two instead of replacing, with
`AbortSignal.any([ctx.request.signal, own])` where your runtimes support it.

### If a middleware calls `next()` long after the call timed out

It no longer sends a request. `next()` returns the `Result` the caller already
received. Before, a middleware that installed a fresh signal of its own could
still send one nobody was waiting for.

Under `dedupe: true`, a request still in flight when the call is settled this
way is aborted, not left running: nothing else can cancel it once the call has
given up its dedupe slot.

---

## Upgrading to 4.4.0

One change needs action, and only if you use `defineRequest` with a `path`
containing a `#`.

### A fragment in a `defineRequest` path literal is now a compile error

If your build goes red on a line like this, that is this change:

```ts
defineRequest<Doc>()({ method: 'GET', path: '/docs#section' })
//                                          ^ Property '__fragmentInPath' is missing:
//                                            a URL fragment is never sent to the server
```

**Your code was already broken.** A URL fragment is never transmitted — `fetch`
strips it — so this endpoint could never reach `/docs#section`. Since 4.2.1 it
has been returning an error `Result` on **every call**. The only thing that
changed in 4.4.0 is *when* you find out: at compile time, where you declared it,
instead of at runtime on every request.

**The fix is to delete the fragment:**

```ts
// before
defineRequest<Doc>()({ method: 'GET', path: '/docs#section' })

// after
defineRequest<Doc>()({ method: 'GET', path: '/docs' })
```

If the fragment was carrying information you need on the server, it has to move
into the path or the query string, because the server never received it:

```ts
defineRequest<Doc>()({ method: 'GET', path: '/docs/:section' })
// or
defineRequest<Doc>()({ method: 'GET', path: '/docs' })  // then pass { section } as a param
```

### What is not affected

The check reads the **path literal**, so these all still compile and behave
exactly as before — they are caught by the runtime error instead:

```ts
const path: string = loadFromConfig()
defineRequest<Doc>()({ method: 'GET', path })          // not a literal

const cfg: RequestConfig = { method: 'GET', path: '/docs#section' }
defineRequest<Doc>()({ ...cfg, path: cfg.path })       // widened to string

new Request<P, Doc>({ method: 'GET', path: '/docs#section' })  // no path literal to read
```

`new Request` has no equivalent check because its constructor takes no path type
parameter to read a literal from. That asymmetry is the reason `defineRequest`
exists.

---

## Upgrading to 4.2.1

One change needs action, and only if a `path` or `baseUrl` of yours contains a
`#`.

### A URL fragment is now refused

A fragment is never transmitted — `fetch` strips it — so one in a request URL
could never do what it looked like it did. Worse, it silently swallowed the
query string:

```ts
new Request({ method: 'GET', path: '/docs#section' })

// 4.2.0 and earlier
await api.docs({ page: 2 })
// URL built:     '/docs#section?page=2'
// what was sent: path '/docs', NO query at all -- page=2 was dropped, silently

// 4.2.1
await api.docs({ page: 2 })
// error.kind === 'network'
// "A URL fragment is never sent to the server, so it cannot appear in a path.
//  Remove "#section" from "/docs#section"."
```

**What to do:** delete the fragment from the template. Nothing else changes —
the params that were being dropped now reach the server.

If neither your `baseUrl` nor any `path` contains a `#`, this release is a
no-op for you, and the `baseUrl` fix below needs nothing from you either.

### A `baseUrl` with a query string now works

No action required — this only replaces broken output with correct output. If
your `baseUrl` carried a query string (`https://api.example.com/v1?key=abc`),
the path was previously appended *inside* the query value, so requests resolved
to the base path and went to the wrong endpoint. They now go where they should,
with the base's params merged ahead of the call's.

## Upgrading to 4.0.0

One rule changes: **a success must carry data.** If you declared
`responseType: 'none'` on the endpoints 3.1.0's warning named, this release is
a no-op for you.

### 1. An empty body under `responseType: 'json'` is now an error

```ts
// A DELETE that answers 204 No Content, responseType left at the default:

// 3.x
const { data, error } = await api.deleteUser({ id: '42' })
// error === null, data === null  -- and `data.deleted` compiles, then throws

// 4.0.0
const { data, error } = await api.deleteUser({ id: '42' })
// error.kind === 'parse', error.status === 204, data === null
```

This is what makes `SuccessResult.data: TResponse` true. 3.0.0 made `Result<T>`
a discriminated union so `if (error) return` narrows `data` — but an empty body
produced `null` behind a non-null `TResponse`, so the narrowing was a lie for
exactly the endpoints least likely to be checked.

**The fix, on every endpoint that answers with no body:**

```ts
const deleteUser = new Request<{ id: string }, undefined>({
  method: 'DELETE',
  path: '/users/:id',
  responseType: 'none',   // available since 3.1.0
})
```

`'none'` reads no body on success, so it never reaches the rule. Non-2xx
responses are unaffected — their body is still read and parsed for
`error.body`, on `'none'` as on `'json'`.

**There is no 204 special case.** One rule — declared JSON, got no JSON —
applies at every status. A `200` with an empty body behaves identically to a
`204`.

**A literal `null` body still succeeds.** `JSON.parse("null")` is valid JSON, so
a server that sends the body `null` is sending data. Only a zero-length body is
an error.

**Which endpoints are affected?** 3.1.0 told you, by name, once per request:
any endpoint that logged `[apify] <name>: server returned an empty body`. If you
are coming from 3.1.0 and never saw that warning in development or staging, no
endpoint of yours hits this path.

### 2. A GraphQL response with no `data` is now an error

The same rule, at the GraphQL client's own seam. A 2xx response carrying
neither `data` nor `errors` used to resolve as a success with `data: null`:

```ts
// Server returns 200 with body {}  (or "", or {"data": null})

// 3.x
const { data, error } = await client.getUser({ id: '1' })
// error === null, data === null

// 4.0.0
const { data, error } = await client.getUser({ id: '1' })
// error.kind === 'parse', error.status === 200, error.body === '{}'
```

`error.body` carries the raw response text, which is the only useful answer to
"then what did the server send?".

**GraphQL errors are unchanged.** A `{"data": null, "errors": [...]}` response —
the legitimate shape for a field error — still reports `kind: 'http'` with the
errors in `error.body` and any partial result in `error.partialData`, exactly as
before. Only a response reporting *no* errors and *no* data is affected, which
the GraphQL over HTTP spec does not permit.

### 3. The one-time empty-body warning is gone

3.1.0's `console.warn` has served its purpose and is removed. Nothing replaces
it — the condition it warned about is now reported as an error through the
normal `Result`.

### Nothing to do if…

- every endpoint that returns no body already declares `responseType: 'none'`, or
- you never saw 3.1.0's empty-body warning, or
- your GraphQL server always answers with `data` or `errors` (i.e. it is
  spec-compliant).

In those cases 4.0.0 is a drop-in upgrade.

---

## Upgrading to 3.1.0

3.1.0 is additive — no existing behaviour changed, and no action is required
to upgrade. It adds one new `responseType` option and a diagnostic warning;
read on if either applies to you.

### 1. New: `responseType: 'none'`

Declares that an endpoint returns no body on success — the accurate
declaration for a `204`, or a `200` with an empty body, most commonly a
`DELETE`. Before 3.1.0, that shape only had `responseType: 'json'` (the
default) to reach for, which parses an empty body to `data: null` at runtime
while `TResponse` claims otherwise:

```ts
// Before — TResponse widened to admit the null the endpoint actually returns
const deleteUserBefore = new Request<{ id: string }, { deleted: boolean } | null>({
  method: 'DELETE',
  path: '/users/:id',
})
const before = await api.deleteUserBefore({ id: '42' })
if (before.error) return
if (before.data) console.log(before.data.deleted) // null-check required even though error was null

// After — responseType: 'none' says exactly what happens: no body, ever
const deleteUserAfter = new Request<{ id: string }, undefined>({
  method: 'DELETE',
  path: '/users/:id',
  responseType: 'none',
})
const after = await api.deleteUserAfter({ id: '42' })
if (after.error) return
console.log(after.data) // undefined -- no null-check needed, and none is possible
```

Declare `TResponse` as `undefined` when using `responseType: 'none'` — this
is a convention, not a compile-time guarantee, and `new Request<P,
User>({ responseType: 'none' })` compiles without error. A non-2xx response
is unaffected: its body is still read and parsed as JSON for `error.body`,
since an error body (a message, a code) is worth reading even when the
caller wants nothing back on success.

**Known limitation:** the compiler does not check the `responseType: 'none'`
/ `TResponse` pairing. Mismatch them and `data` is `undefined` at runtime
behind whatever type you declared, with no compile error to catch it.

### 2. You may see a one-time console warning

If any existing endpoint declares `responseType: 'json'` (the default) and
the server answers with an empty body, 3.1.0 now logs this once per request
name, per `createApi` instance:

```
[apify] deleteUser: server returned an empty body for responseType 'json'. This yields data: null today and will be an error in 4.0.0. Declare responseType: 'none' if the endpoint returns no content.
```

This is a diagnostic, not a behaviour change — the call still resolves as a
success with `data: null`, exactly as it always has. It means the named
request is one of the empty-body endpoints described above, and declaring
`responseType: 'none'` on it both makes `TResponse` accurate and silences the
warning.

### 3. 4.0.0: the empty-body rule (shipped)

This shipped. See [Upgrading to 4.0.0](#upgrading-to-400) — an empty body under
`responseType: 'json'` is now a `kind: 'parse'` error, and declaring
`responseType: 'none'` makes that upgrade a no-op.

## Upgrading to 3.0.0

3.0.0 tightens contracts the library always implied but never enforced. Most
of it is types catching up to behaviour that was already there; the error
*classification* changes (parse failures, aborts) change what a `Result`
actually contains for a narrow set of cases. Read the "Nothing to do if…"
section at the end first — it covers the common case.

### 1. `Result<T>` is a discriminated union, not an interface

`data` and `error` used to be independent nullable fields, so `if (error)
return` never narrowed `data` — every consumer had to write `data!` or a
redundant null check. `Result<T>` is now `SuccessResult<T> | ErrorResult<T>`
(both exported), and checking `error` narrows `data` for real:

```ts
const { data, error } = await api.getUser({ id: '42' })
if (error) return
// 2.x → data: User | null, so data!.name (or a redundant `if (!data) return`)
// 3.0.0 → data: User, so data.name — the `!` and the redundant check can go
console.log(data.name)
```

**If you have custom middleware that synthesises a *success* `Result`**
(short-circuits with `{ data, error: null, response, retry }` rather than
calling `next()`), it must now supply a non-null `Response` — the type no
longer allows `response: null` on the success branch. There is no runtime
change here: the library's own factories (`createSuccessResult` and friends)
already only ever produced exactly these shapes, so this is a compile-time
tightening, not a behaviour change, for any middleware that was already
well-formed.

### 2. `Request` generics are no longer interchangeable

`Request<TParams, TResponse>` never referenced its own generics in the class
body, so every instantiation was structurally identical to TypeScript and
`Request<{ id: string }, User>` silently accepted a `Request<{ slug: string
}, Post>` wherever one was expected. Phantom fields now make the generics
load-bearing:

```ts
const getUser = new Request<{ id: string }, User>({ method: 'GET', path: '/users/:id' })
const getPost = new Request<{ slug: string }, Post>({ method: 'GET', path: '/posts/:slug' })

function useRequest(r: Request<{ id: string }, User>) { /* ... */ }

useRequest(getUser)  // fine, always was
useRequest(getPost)
// 2.x   → compiled (both Requests looked identical to the type system)
// 3.0.0 → compile error: Request<{ slug: string }, Post> is not assignable
//         to Request<{ id: string }, User>
```

**What to do:** if this fires after upgrading, the assignment was already
wrong — the two `Request`s describe different endpoints and were never
actually interchangeable at runtime. Fix the annotation to match the real
endpoint.

### 3. `ApiError.kind` is required, and gained `'middleware'`

`kind` shipped optional in 2.2.0; every construction site inside the library
already set it, so this is the type catching up. `ApiErrorKind` is now
`'http' | 'network' | 'abort' | 'timeout' | 'parse' | 'middleware'`.

```ts
// Custom middleware constructing its own ApiError (e.g. to short-circuit
// with a validation failure) must now supply `kind`:
new ApiError({
  status: 422,
  kind: 'http',            // 3.0.0: required — omitting this is a type error
  statusText: 'Unprocessable Entity',
  body: { message: 'invalid payload' },
  headers: new Headers(),
  request: { method: 'POST', url, params },
})
```

**If you have an exhaustive `switch (error.kind)`** (or a mapped type keyed on
`ApiErrorKind`), it needs a new `'middleware'` arm — see #5 below for what
produces it.

### 4. Parse failures on a 2xx response changed shape

**Scope: 2xx responses only.** A 2xx response whose body failed to parse
according to `responseType` previously reported `status: 0`, `response:
null`, `kind: 'network'` — indistinguishable from being offline, and the
`Response` (status, headers) was discarded even though the server did
respond. It now reports the real `status`, a non-null `response`, and `kind:
'parse'`:

```ts
const { error } = await api.getUser({ id: '42' })  // server sent 200 with an unparseable body
// 2.x   → error.status === 0, error.response === null, error.kind === 'network'
// 3.0.0 → error.status === 200, error.response !== null, error.kind === 'parse'
```

**Non-2xx responses are unaffected.** `!response.ok` is checked before the
body is parsed, so a 5xx with an unparseable body already reported (and still
reports) `kind: 'http'` with the real status — **`retryMiddleware`'s default
5xx retry behaviour has not changed.** Do not treat this as "parse errors are
now retried differently"; only the 2xx case moved.

**What to do:** code that branched on `status === 0` (or `kind === 'network'`)
to mean "the user is offline" now needs to also handle `kind: 'parse'`
explicitly if it wants to keep distinguishing "offline" from "the server
responded with something we couldn't read." Code that only checked `if
(error)` and logged generically needs no changes.

### 5. A throwing middleware returns a `Result` instead of rejecting

`composeMiddleware`'s dispatch has no guard, so an `async` middleware that
threw used to reject the caller's promise — breaking the "never throws"
contract for the one path most likely to have a bug (your own middleware). It
now produces an ordinary `Result` with `kind: 'middleware'`:

```ts
const buggyMiddleware: Middleware = async (ctx, next) => {
  throw new Error('oops')
}

// 2.x
try {
  const result = await api.getUser({ id: '42' })
} catch (err) {
  // had to catch here — a middleware bug rejected the call
}

// 3.0.0 — no try/catch needed; remove it
const { error } = await api.getUser({ id: '42' })
if (error?.kind === 'middleware') {
  // error.body is the Error the middleware threw
}
```

**What to do:** delete any `try`/`catch` you placed around an API call
specifically to catch a middleware's throw. It's dead code now — the call
never rejects — and the failure is available as `error.kind === 'middleware'`
instead.

### 6. `onError` no longer fires for `error.kind === 'abort'`

Every `dedupe` supersede and every caller-initiated cancellation used to reach
`onError` — i.e. your Sentry — as a reported error, even though the library
caused it deliberately. `'timeout'` is unaffected and still fires: a deadline
you missed is a real failure, unlike a cancellation you caused yourself.

```ts
const controller = new AbortController()
const promise = api.getUser({ id: '42' }, { signal: controller.signal })
controller.abort()
await promise
// 2.x   → onError(error) fires with error.kind === 'abort'
// 3.0.0 → onError does not fire; the caller still gets the abort Result back
```

**What to do:** delete any hand-rolled filtering you added to your `onError`
handler to ignore `AbortError`/cancellations (e.g. `if (error.body?.name ===
'AbortError') return`) — the library now does this for you, unconditionally,
for every abort it produces.

### 7. Aborts are classified by provenance, not by the reason's name

This is the change most likely to surface silently, because it changes
`kind` for shapes that used to look like something else entirely.
Previously, the library guessed a cancellation by sniffing the *thrown
value's* `.name` (`'AbortError'` / `'TimeoutError'`). Now it asks a different
question: **did the signal that actually governs this request abort?** If
yes, the failure is `'abort'`/`'timeout'` regardless of what was thrown or
what it's named; if no, sniffing the thrown value's shape is the fallback.
Four consequences:

- **A caller's own custom abort reason is now silent, not reported.**
  `controller.abort(new Error('unmounted'))` or `controller.abort('cancelled')`
  used to fail the old name-based sniff (the reason isn't named
  `AbortError`), so it fell through to `kind: 'network'` and reached
  `onError`. It's now `kind: 'abort'` — correctly classified as *your*
  cancellation — and, per #6, `onError` doesn't fire for it.

  ```ts
  controller.abort(new Error('component unmounted'))
  // 2.x   → error.kind === 'network', reported to onError
  // 3.0.0 → error.kind === 'abort', not reported
  ```

  **What to do:** if you were branching on `error.kind === 'network'` (or
  `error.status === 0`) to mean "offline," and relying on a custom abort
  reason to *also* hit that branch, it no longer will. Branch on `kind ===
  'abort'` explicitly if you still want to observe your own cancellations.

- **A middleware that propagates the library's own abort reason now returns a
  silent `kind: 'abort'` `Result`, instead of rejecting the caller's promise
  outright.** This covers both re-throwing the exact reason (`throw
  ctx.request.signal.reason`) and the shape `node:timers/promises` and most
  abortable helpers actually produce — a fresh `AbortError` whose `.cause` is
  the signal's reason:

  ```ts
  import { setTimeout as delay } from 'node:timers/promises'

  const backoff: Middleware = async (ctx, next) => {
    await delay(100, undefined, { signal: ctx.request.signal })
    return next()
  }
  // if ctx.request.signal aborts during the delay, `delay` rejects with an
  // AbortError whose `.cause` is ctx.request.signal.reason
  // 2.x   → non-shared: composeMiddleware's chain had no rejection handler at
  //         all, so the caller's own promise rejects with the raw AbortError
  //         — no Result, "kind" does not apply, onError never runs.
  //         Under `share: true` specifically, this *was* already converted to
  //         a Result (the share site's own rejection handler, present since
  //         2.2.0), classified `kind: 'abort'` by sniffing the thrown value's
  //         `.name` — the same name-based sniff #7's intro paragraph
  //         describes, so it could not tell this genuine propagation apart
  //         from bullet 3's unrelated-failure case below. Reported either way
  //         (no abort suppression existed yet).
  // 3.0.0 → error.kind === 'abort' (recognised as propagating our own signal,
  //         not merely name-matched), returned as an ordinary Result on every
  //         path, not reported
  ```

  **What to do:** delete any `try`/`catch` you placed around this kind of
  call for the same reason as #5. Code was already correct if it treated this
  as `kind: 'abort'` — it just could not have relied on that being *reliable*
  (see bullet 3, which used to collide with this one under the old
  name-based sniff). Middleware authors: see the "worth knowing" note below
  about not attaching `signal.reason` as `.cause` to your *own* unrelated
  failures — doing so makes them indistinguishable from this propagation
  case.

- **A middleware throwing its own, unrelated `AbortError`-named failure now
  reaches `onError` classified as `'middleware'`, as an ordinary `Result`,
  instead of rejecting the caller's promise outright.** An IndexedDB quota
  abort, say, rethrown by a caching middleware, has nothing to do with this
  request's own signal:

  ```ts
  // 2.x   → non-shared: composeMiddleware's chain had no rejection handler at
  //         all, so the caller's own promise rejects with the raw AbortError
  //         — no Result, "kind" does not apply, onError never runs.
  //         Under `share: true`, this was already converted to a Result, but
  //         misclassified `kind: 'abort'` by the same name-based sniff as
  //         bullet 2 above — 'middleware' did not exist as a kind at all
  //         before this release, on either path — and was reported (no
  //         suppression existed for 'abort' yet either).
  // 3.0.0 → error.kind === 'middleware' (not a propagation of our signal),
  //         returned as an ordinary Result on every path, reported
  ```

  **What to do:** nothing to change in your code, but expect to *start*
  seeing these correctly labelled `kind: 'middleware'` instead of either an
  unhandled rejection (non-shared) or a misleading `kind: 'abort'` (shared) —
  if you have middleware that can throw an `AbortError`-named failure
  unrelated to request cancellation. See #5 above: this is the same
  "throwing middleware now returns a Result" change, just for a failure that
  happens to be named like an abort.

- **Any abort of the exact signal handed to `fetch` — including one installed
  by middleware — is now `'abort'`/`'timeout'` and silent**, not classified by
  what was thrown. A middleware that replaces `ctx.request.signal` (e.g. a
  per-attempt timeout) and whose replacement signal aborts now gets the same
  cancellation treatment as any other abort on the operative signal.

**What to do, generally:** grep your `onError` handler and any code branching
on `error.kind` or `error.status === 0` for logic that assumed "not named
`AbortError`" meant "not a cancellation," or that assumed `kind ===
'middleware'` was reserved for genuine middleware bugs. Both assumptions are
now wrong in the specific ways above.

### 8. Cancelling during the response body download is now classified as the cancellation

Aborting after headers arrive but while the body is still downloading — a
component unmounting mid-fetch, a deadline firing mid-download — used to be
misclassified for a **non-2xx** response specifically. The **2xx** case
already produced the right `kind`/`status`/`response` shape in 2.2.1; only
whether it was *reported* changes there, which is entirely #6 (`onError` no
longer fires for `'abort'`), not a distinct shape change:

```ts
// A slow response body, aborted partway through download:
// 2xx response (e.g. a slow success payload):
//   2.x   → kind: 'abort' (or 'network', if the thrown value wasn't
//           name-recognisable as AbortError/TimeoutError), status: 0,
//           response: null — reported (2.2.1 had no abort suppression at all)
//   3.0.0 → kind: 'abort' (or 'timeout'), status: 0, response: null — not
//           reported (same shape, see #6 for why reporting stops)
// non-2xx response (e.g. a slow 502 gateway page) — this is the real shape change:
//   2.x   → kind: 'http', the real status, response present, body: null —
//           reported, regardless of whether the cancellation was ours
//   3.0.0 → kind: 'abort' (or 'timeout'), status: 0, response: null — not reported
```

Two concrete hazards to check for, both specific to the **non-2xx** case:

- **Code branching on `error.status` for a cancellation that lands while a
  non-2xx body downloads** now sees `status: 0` instead of the real status —
  the same "was this reported?" question as #6/#7 applies.
- **Code reading `result.response!.headers` (or any non-null assertion on
  `response`) for that same non-2xx-cancellation case** must now handle
  `response === null` — it previously had a real `response` (with `body:
  null`), even though the request never actually finished.

**Also:** `retryMiddleware`'s default `retryOn` (and any custom `retryOn`
keyed on `status >= 500`) no longer retries a cancellation caught in this
window, because `status` is now `0`, not the real (often 5xx-shaped) status.
This is strictly correct — retrying a cancellation you caused is never
useful — but it means **fewer requests** for code that happened to rely on
the old misclassification triggering a retry.

### 9. GraphQL partial data is preserved (additive)

A GraphQL response with both `data` and `errors` (partial success — a
nullable field errored while the rest of the query resolved) used to discard
`data` entirely. It's now available as `error.partialData`:

```ts
const { error } = await graphql.getCategory({ id: '123' })
if (error) {
  console.log(error.body)          // GraphQLError[]
  console.log(error.partialData)   // the data the server sent alongside the errors, or undefined
}
```

This lives on `error.partialData`, not `result.data` — putting it on `data`
would break the `Result` union's narrowing from #1: a non-null `error` means
`data` is null, and a null `error` means the call succeeded (see the
empty-body caveat below). Nothing to change unless you want to start using
it.

### Worth knowing, no action needed

- **A genuinely malformed body arriving while the signal *happens* to already
  be aborted is classified as the cancellation, and so dropped from
  `onError`**, even when the abort didn't actually cause the parse failure.
  The guard asks "is the signal aborted right now," not "did the abort cause
  this" — narrowing that further would require `parseResponse` to
  distinguish its own read failure from a parse failure across all five
  response types, which it doesn't attempt. In practice this only matters if
  you're relying on `onError` to catch every malformed-body case with
  certainty; it's a narrow, pre-existing edge case, not a new hazard to
  design around.
- **Middleware authors: do not attach `signal.reason` as `.cause` to your
  own, unrelated failure.** `throw new Error('cache write failed', { cause:
  ctx.request.signal.reason })` is read as *relaying* the library's own
  cancellation (see #7's `.cause`-unwrapping case) and silently dropped as
  `'abort'`, even though your error is about something else entirely (a cache
  write, not a cancellation) that merely happened to occur while the signal
  was aborted. Use a different field to carry that context —
  `{ cause: new Error('disk full') }`, or a custom property — and reserve
  `.cause` for genuine propagation of the signal's own reason.
- **`SuccessResult.data` is typed `TResponse`, not `TResponse | null` — but an
  empty body still parses to `null` at runtime.** A `DELETE` that answers
  `200` with no body (or a `204`) is one of the most common REST shapes, and
  `parseResponse` returns `null` for it exactly as it always has (see the
  `responseType` reference for the empty-body case). 3.0.0 removes the `| null`
  from the *type*, not from the *behaviour*: `error` is still `null` on that
  response, so `data` narrows to `TResponse` and compiles, but the value you
  get is `null` anyway.

  ```ts
  const deleteUser = new Request<{ id: string }, { deleted: boolean }>({
    method: 'DELETE', path: '/users/:id',
  })
  const { data, error } = await api.deleteUser({ id: '42' })
  if (error) return
  console.log(data.deleted) // throws: data is null at runtime for a 200/204 empty body
  ```

  If an endpoint can answer 204 or an empty 200, say so accurately in its own
  `TResponse`. **This guidance changed in 3.1.0:** at the time of the 3.0.0
  release, the only option was widening to `Request<{ id: string }, { deleted:
  boolean } | null>` and handling the `null` case explicitly; as of 3.1.0, use
  `responseType: 'none'` instead (see [Upgrading to
  3.1.0](#upgrading-to-310) above) — it's more accurate (declares "no body,"
  not "body or null") and it silences the empty-body warning 3.1.0 added. This
  is not a new *behaviour* (2.2.1 had the identical runtime `null`); what
  changed in 3.0.0 is that the type system no longer forces you to handle it,
  and what changed in 3.1.0 is the recommended way to handle it anyway.

### Nothing to do if…

…you only call API methods and check `error`, **and every endpoint's
`TResponse` accounts for its own empty-body responses** (see the bullet
above — as of 3.1.0, a `DELETE`/204/empty-200 endpoint should declare
`responseType: 'none'` to stay accurate; everything else needs no change):

```ts
const { data, error } = await api.getUser({ id: '42' })
if (error) {
  console.error(error.status, error.body)
  return
}
console.log(data.name)
```

The only change visible here is a good one: `data!.name` becomes `data.name`
(the `!` is now unnecessary and can be deleted, but leaving it is harmless —
a non-null assertion on an already-non-null value is a no-op). No behavior
changes for this pattern.

## Upgrading to 2.2.0

2.2.0 is additive — no API changed shape, and there is nothing you need to do.

### Worth knowing, no action needed

- **Abort reasons now survive `dedupe`.** Previously, a `dedupe: true`
  request's merged signal always aborted with a generic, reason-less
  `AbortError`, regardless of what actually caused the abort:

  ```ts
  const withTimeout: Middleware = async (ctx, next) => {
    ctx.request.signal = AbortSignal.timeout(20)
    return next()
  }

  const api = createApi({
    baseUrl: '/api',
    requests: { getUser }, // getUser has dedupe: true
    middleware: [withTimeout],
  })

  const { error } = await api.getUser({ id: '42' })
  // 2.1.0 → error.body.name === 'AbortError'   -- the real cause (a timeout) was lost
  // 2.2.0 → error.body.name === 'TimeoutError' -- the actual cause survives
  ```

  This only differs when `dedupe: true` is combined with a caller-supplied
  `signal` or a signal-setting middleware — plain `dedupe: true` with no
  external signal involved is unaffected. `error.body.name` (and any custom
  reason you pass to your own `AbortController.abort(reason)`) is a
  **pre-2.2.0 surface** — existing code reading it does not need to touch
  anything new to notice this, since it never had to opt into `kind` to read
  `.name` in the first place. Going forward, prefer branching on the new
  `error.kind` (`'timeout'` vs `'abort'` vs `'network'`) instead of
  `error.body.name` — it's the field the library commits to maintaining.

- **Retries now back off instead of firing instantly.** `retryMiddleware(3)`
  previously made all four attempts in the same tick, with no delay between
  them. It now waits out a real backoff (exponential by default, with jitter)
  between attempts, so a retrying request takes measurably longer in
  wall-clock terms. Nothing breaks, but a test asserting on elapsed time
  around a retrying call may need its tolerance revisited — or pass
  `retryMiddleware({ baseDelay: 0, jitter: false })` to keep the old, instant
  timing.

## Upgrading to 2.1.0

2.1.0 is a non-breaking release, but **two changes can surface as new errors** in
code that was already subtly wrong. Neither requires an API change on your side.

### The Node floor moved from 18 to 20

Node 18 reached end-of-life on 2025-04-30, and CI never tested it — the "Node 18+"
claim in the README was untested, which is worse than not making it. `package.json`
now declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`.

**What to do:** if you are on Node 18, nothing breaks today — the library uses no
API that Node 18 lacks. But the version is unsupported and untested, so treat this
as notice rather than a guarantee.

### Path parameter mismatches now fail loudly

Previously, a mismatch between a request's params and its path template shipped a
malformed URL and said nothing:

```ts
const getUser = new Request<{ id: string }, User>({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/users/:userId',   // note: :userId, but the param is `id`
})

await api.getUser({ id: '42' })
// 2.0.0 → GET /api/users/:userId?id=42   ← literal token, value duplicated as a query param
// 2.1.0 → Result with an error; no request is made
```

The 2.1.0 result is an ordinary error `Result`, not a thrown exception — the
never-throws contract is intact:

```ts
const { error } = await api.getUser({ id: '42' })
// error.status === 0
// String(error.body) === 'TypeError: Unresolved path parameter :userId in path "/users/:userId". …'
```

**What to do:** if this fires after upgrading, the endpoint was making a malformed
request all along. Align the param name with the path token (or vice versa). The
error message names the offending token and the path.

**Related:** `baseUrl` and `path` now join with exactly one slash, so a `baseUrl`
ending in `/` no longer produces `//`. If a server was tolerating (or redirecting)
the double slash, requests will now go to the correct URL — worth checking if you
have path-sensitive routing or logging.

### Worth knowing, no action needed

- `ctx.request.signal` is now readable and writable from middleware, which makes
  timeouts and cancel-on-condition writable in userland for the first time:

  ```ts
  const timeout = (ms: number): Middleware => async (ctx, next) => {
    ctx.request.signal = AbortSignal.timeout(ms)
    return next()
  }
  ```

  It composes with `dedupe: true` — dedupe merges whatever signal is current
  rather than discarding it.

- The published package is roughly half its former size (240.6 kB → 112.7 kB
  unpacked). Source maps were dropped: they referenced `../src/*.ts`, which was
  never published, and carried no `sourcesContent`, so they resolved to nothing
  in every consumer. JSDoc still ships in the `.d.ts` files, so editor hover
  documentation is unchanged.
