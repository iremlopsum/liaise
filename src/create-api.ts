// create-api.ts — The core API client constructor for the liaise library
// =============================================================================
//
// This is the heart of the library. It takes a set of Request definitions and
// wires them together with middleware, headers, and the native fetch API into a
// typed API object where each key becomes a callable method.
//
// The flow for each API call:
//
//   1. Caller invokes api.getUser({ id: '42' }, { signal, headers, ... })
//   2. createApi's generated method:
//      a. Builds the URL (path param substitution + optional query string)
//      b. Merges headers (global < per-request < per-call)
//      c. Serializes the body (JSON, FormData, etc.)
//      d. Computes the effective abort signal (with dedupe if enabled)
//      e. Composes middleware (global + per-request + per-call, minus skipped)
//      f. Executes the composed chain → core fetch → returns Result
//      g. Fires onError if the final result has an error
//
// The generated methods are fully typed — TypeScript infers the params and
// response types from the Request<TParams, TResponse> generics. When TParams
// is Record<string, never>, the params argument becomes optional.
//
// Design decisions:
// - retry() re-enters execute(), which rebuilds the full middleware chain.
//   This ensures auth tokens, logging, etc. all fire again on retry.
// - The entire execute() body is wrapped in try/catch to handle synchronous
//   errors (e.g., TypeError from buildUrl for nested objects in query strings).
//   These are returned as Result errors, not unhandled rejections.
// - onError fires AFTER the middleware chain, so retry middleware can recover
//   errors without triggering the global error handler.
// - Dedupe integration is handled transparently — when a Request has
//   dedupe: true, the signal is routed through a DedupeTracker that
//   auto-cancels previous in-flight requests for the same endpoint.

/**
 * Builds a `Result` for a failure that never reached (or never came back

 *
 * Three situations produce one:
 *
 * - a sharer giving up before the shared request settles (`'abort'`) — the
 *   shared request itself is unaffected unless this was the last reference,
 *   which is the refcount's job, not this function's;
 * - a synchronous error during request setup (`'network'`), most often the
 *   `TypeError` `buildUrl` throws for a nested query-string object;
 * - a rejection escaping the middleware chain (`'middleware'`, or `'network'`
 *   for a setup failure).
 *
 * Classification is by **provenance**, not by sniffing `reason`'s shape: a
 * failure only counts as *our* cancellation when `signal` — the AbortSignal
 * that actually governs this operation — is the one that aborted. That is
 * what lets a caller's custom abort reason (`ac.abort(new Error('x'))`, or a
 * plain string) still classify as `'abort'`/`'timeout'` instead of falling
 * through to `'network'` — `abortKind` only recognises the standard
 * `AbortError`/`TimeoutError` names, but the signal itself always knows why
 * it aborted regardless of what shape its `reason` takes.
 *
 * For a `'middleware'` fallback this additionally requires `reason` to
 * *propagate* `signal.reason` (see `propagatesReason` — exact identity, or
 * one level of `.cause`). A middleware can throw its own `AbortError`-named
 * failure that has nothing to do with this request's own signal — a
 * rethrown IndexedDB quota abort, say — and that must stay `'middleware'`,
 * not be swallowed as `'abort'` just because the name matches. Propagation
 * is a heuristic for that, not proof — `propagatesReason`'s doc names the
 * known false positive (a middleware's own error using `{ cause }` to
 * explain *why* it failed, not to claim it *is* the cancellation) — but it's
 * the closest approximation available, and rejecting it in favour of exact
 * identity alone is measurably worse (see the same doc). A non-`'middleware'`
 * fallback doesn't need that check: a fetch rejection while our own signal
 * is aborted IS that cancellation, whatever shape fetch happened to throw.
 *
 * `error.request.url` here is exactly the `url` argument passed in below —
 * see `buildFailedResult`'s doc, inside `createApi`, for where it comes from.
 * Every call site reports a resolved, path-substituted address: the two
 * `'middleware'` sites pass `context.request.url` explicitly, because only
 * they can observe a middleware that rewrote it, and everything else takes
 * `urlForError`, which rebuilds it through the same `resolveRequestUrl` Step 4
 * uses. The un-substituted template survives in one case only — `buildUrl`
 * itself threw, so no URL was ever resolvable.

/**
 * Creates a typed API client from a set of Request definitions.
 *
 * This is the primary entry point of the liaise library. It takes a configuration
 * object containing a base URL, request definitions, optional global middleware,
 * default headers, and an error callback, and returns an object where each request
 * key becomes a callable, fully-typed method.
 *
 * **How it works internally:**
 *
 * For each Request in the `requests` record, createApi generates a method that:
 * 1. Builds the URL from baseUrl + path template + params (path param substitution)
 * 2. Merges headers from three layers (global < per-request < per-call)
 * 3. Serializes the body (JSON for plain objects, passthrough for FormData/Blob/etc.)
 * 4. Computes the effective abort signal (includes dedupe tracking if enabled)
 * 5. Composes the middleware chain (global → per-request → per-call, minus skipped)
 * 6. Executes the chain, with the core fetch as the innermost layer
 * 7. Fires the onError callback if the final result has an error
 *
 * **Dedupe integration:**
 *
 * A single DedupeTracker instance is created per createApi call. When a Request
 * has `dedupe: true`, the abort signal is routed through the tracker before being
 * passed to fetch. This means that firing a new request for the same endpoint
 * automatically cancels any previous in-flight request — perfect for
 * search-as-you-type, paginated lists, or rapidly changing filters.
 *
 * **Error handling philosophy:**
 *
 * The library never throws — every outcome is expressed as a Result<T>.
 * - HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx) → Result with error, response, and retry
 * - Network errors → Result with error (status 0), null response, and retry
 * - Synchronous errors (e.g., TypeError from query string serialization) → same
 *
 * @typeParam TRequests - Record of Request instances. Keys become method names,
 *   and the Request's TParams/TResponse generics become the method's signature.
 *
 * @param config - API configuration with baseUrl, requests, middleware, headers, onError.
 * @returns A typed object where each request key is a callable method.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const api = createApi({
 *   baseUrl: '/api',
 *   requests: { getUser, listUsers, createUser },
 *   middleware: [authMiddleware, logMiddleware],
 *   headers: { 'X-App-Version': '2.0.0' },
 *   onError: (error) => Sentry.captureException(error),
 * })
 *
 * // Fully typed: params and response inferred from Request generics
 * const { data, error, retry } = await api.getUser({ id: '42' })
 * ```

       * passed as the `retry` callback in Result objects. When the caller
       * calls `result.retry()`, it re-enters execute() from scratch —
       * rebuilding the URL, re-merging headers, re-composing middleware,
       * and re-executing the fetch. This ensures that retry always goes
       * through the full pipeline (auth re-injection, logging, etc.).
       *
       * The entire body is wrapped in try/catch to capture synchronous
       * errors (e.g., TypeError from buildUrl when a nested object is
       * passed as a query string param). These are returned as Result
       * errors rather than unhandled rejections, keeping the "never throws"
       * contract intact.
       *
       * `sharedSignal`, when given, is merged with the operation's own
       * deadline to form the signal that actually drives the fetch, displacing
       * this caller's personal `options.signal` / timeout from it. It is never
       * an override — hence the name. This is used only by the `share: true`
       * path below: the first caller to acquire a shared slot hands `execute`
       * the ShareTracker's own refcounted signal, so the real network request
       * is governed by "has every sharer given up?" rather than by any single
       * caller's personal signal or timeout.
       * `result.retry()` calls `execute` with no argument — through `retry`,
       * below, never directly — so a retry (shared or not) always falls back
       * to this caller's own `options.signal` / timeout: a retry is a fresh,
       * unshared request.
       *
       * `onSettled`, when given, is invoked the instant this operation has a
       * `Result` and BEFORE that Result is reported to `onError`. The share
       * site uses it to tell a genuine give-up from a vestigial one; see the
       * post-execution hook.

          // a middleware which short-circuits (a cache hit) never cancels a
          // live request that is genuinely in flight, and so that a signal
          // installed by middleware is an input to dedupe rather than
          // something dedupe overwrites.

          // dedupeController doubles as the "already registered" flag: it is

          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          // Resolve the deadline: per-call beats per-request, and non-positive
          // means none. The signal is created once here — not inside core() —
          // so a retry sequence draws from a single budget rather than getting
          // a fresh one per attempt.
          //
          // Under `share` (sharedSignal supplied) only the *per-request*
          // deadline applies here, merged with the refcount signal rather than
          // replacing it. `RequestConfig.timeout` is a property of the
          // operation — "this endpoint must answer within 5s" — so it belongs

          // from when that request started. Suppressing it here instead, and

          // arrival of joiners hold one socket open indefinitely: each new
          // joiner's clock started at *its* join time, and the request itself
          // had no deadline at all.
          //
          // `CallOptions.timeout` is deliberately absent from this branch: a
          // single caller's patience must not shorten (or lengthen) the shared
          // operation for everyone else, so it is observed per-caller at the
          // share site instead.
          //
          // Both deadlines come from one `resolveBudget`, which is the single
          // place that knows the operation/per-caller split. It is resolved
          // here, once per execute(), rather than once per api-method call:

          // deadline, not the exhausted remains of the first attempt's
          // (tests/timeout.test.ts, "gives retry() a fresh budget"). Within a
          // single execute() it is still resolved exactly once, so a
          // retryMiddleware sequence draws from one budget rather than a new
          // one per attempt.
          //
          // `shared` is keyed on whether THIS run was handed the tracker's

          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          const { url, remaining, asQuery, whole } = resolveRequestUrl(baseUrl, request, params)

          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          // Step 5: Merge headers from all three layers
          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          // The merge order determines precedence: later sources override earlier.
          // global (lowest) → per-request → per-call (highest)
          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          const headers = mergeHeaders(globalHeaders, request.config.headers, options.headers)

          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          // Step 6: Serialize the body (for non-query requests)
          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          // For GET/DELETE (asQuery=true), all params went into the query string
          // via buildUrl, so there's no body to serialize.
          //
          // For POST/PUT/PATCH (asQuery=false), the remaining params (those not
          // consumed by path param substitution) become the request body.
          //
          // Special body types (FormData, Blob, etc.) bypass the remaining-params
          // logic and are passed directly to serializeBody, which handles them
          // with appropriate Content-Type detection.
          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          let body: unknown | null = null
          if (!asQuery) {
            // Decide what to serialize: the original params (for special types)
            // or the remaining params after path substitution (for plain objects)
            const toSerialize = whole ? whole.value : remaining

            // Only serialize if there's something to serialize — avoid sending
            // empty bodies ({}) for endpoints with no body params.
            if (whole || Object.keys(remaining).length > 0) {
              const serialized = serializeBody(toSerialize)
              body = serialized.body

              // Auto-set Content-Type if serializeBody determined one AND the
              // caller hasn't explicitly set one (per-call or per-request headers
              // should be able to override the auto-detected type).
              // Note: For FormData, contentType is null because the browser needs
              // to set the multipart boundary automatically.

          }

          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          // Step 7: Build the middleware context
          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          // The context object is what every middleware receives. It contains
          // all information about the request: method, URL, original path,
          // params, headers, and serialized body. Middleware can read and
          // modify headers and body before the fetch executes.
          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          const context: MiddlewareContext = {
            request: {
              method: request.config.method,
              url,
              path: request.config.path,
              params,
              headers,
              body,
              signal: callerSignal
            },
            requestName: name
          }

          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          // Step 8: Compose middleware and execute
          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          // composeMiddleware creates the onion chain: each middleware wraps
          // the next, with the core fetch function at the center.
          // skipMiddleware filters out specific middleware by reference (===).
          //
          // The backstop is what makes `timeout` and `options.signal` bound
          // the whole chain, not only the part that reaches fetch: a
          // middleware awaiting something the signal does not reach (a
          // stalled token refresh) can no longer hold the call past its own
          // deadline. It watches the operation's own signal — the deadline,
          // the caller's signal and, under share, the refcount — and, once
          // it aborts, gives the chain one macrotask to answer before
          // settling with the abort Result itself. See utils/backstop.ts for
          // why the grace period exists. `guard` stops a middleware that
          // resumes after that from sending a request nobody is waiting on.
          // -----------------------------------------------------------------
          const backstop = createBackstop<Result<unknown>>(signal =>
            buildFailedResult(signal.reason, signal, 'abort', context.request.url)
          )
          backstop.watch(callerSignal)
          const composed = composeMiddleware(allMiddleware, backstop.guard(core), options.skipMiddleware ?? [])
          // composeMiddleware has no guard of its own, and execute()'s try/catch
          // only covers the synchronous setup above — so an async middleware
          // that throws escapes as a rejection and breaks the library's one
          // headline guarantee. Convert it here, before the post-execution
          // hook, so the failure reaches onError like any other.
          //
          // A middleware that throws SYNCHRONOUSLY (a plain, non-async
          // function) never gets as far as handing back a promise for
          // `.catch` to attach to — composed(context) itself throws, before
          // this statement finishes evaluating. The surrounding try/catch
          // below already turns that into a Result, but with fallback kind
          // 'network' — correct for a setup error (e.g. buildUrl's
          // TypeError), wrong for a throwing middleware. Catching it here
          // too, right alongside the async case, keeps both classified as
          // 'middleware' and routed through the same post-execution hook.
          let resultPromise: Promise<Result<unknown>>
          try {
            resultPromise = composed(context).catch(
              (err: unknown) => buildFailedResult(err, context.request.signal, 'middleware', context.request.url)
            )

          // b. Fire the onError callback if the final result has an error

            // types, and a non-function here would throw from inside the one
            // path that must always produce a Result.
            // A function that itself throws is guarded too, for the same
            // reason: this hook must never fail a request that already has a
            // perfectly good Result, and a throw here is exactly the kind of
            // consumer-supplied misbehaviour that would resurrect the
            // rejection path the share site's defense-in-depth handlers exist

            //
            //  1. `release()` has exactly one call site — the share site's
            //     `onAbort` — and the `fireOnError` call there is `if
            //     (!hasSettled()) fireOnError(...)`, not unconditional. The
            //     guard can only suppress that caller's own report; it never
            //     adds one, so it can never turn into a SECOND report for
            //     the same operation-level outcome.
            //  2. A sharer with no `perCaller` budget never releases at all.
            //     It takes the `if (!perCaller) return promise.then(...)`

            //     waits, which keeps `refs > 0` and makes abandonment
            //     unreachable while any such caller is still waiting.
            //
