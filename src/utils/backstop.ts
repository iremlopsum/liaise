// =============================================================================
// backstop.ts — settles a call whose middleware ignores the operation's signal
// =============================================================================
//
// The deadline (`timeout`) and the caller's `signal` reach middleware as
// `ctx.request.signal` and reach `fetch` from there. That bounds everything
// the signal governs, and nothing else: a middleware awaiting work of its own
// that never settles — a stalled auth-token refresh is the realistic case —
// used to leave the call pending forever, with no Result and no onError, even
// though `timeout` is documented as covering the whole middleware chain.
//
// A promise cannot be cancelled, so the stalled middleware keeps running. What
// the library can do is stop waiting for it: once the operation's own signal
// aborts, the call settles with the same abort Result `fetch` would have
// produced, and anything the chain does afterwards is discarded.
//
// Both clients use this. They are parallel pipelines (see architecture.md),
// but this piece has no client-specific behaviour, so it is shared rather
// than duplicated.
// =============================================================================
