// path-params.ts — Path parameter substitution and query string building
// =============================================================================
//
// This utility handles the URL construction pipeline:
//
// 1. Start with a base URL and a path template (e.g., '/api' + '/items/:id')
// 2. Scan the params object for keys that match `:param` tokens in the path
// 3. Replace matched tokens with URI-encoded values
// 4. Separate consumed (path) params from remaining params
// 5. Optionally serialize remaining params as a query string
//
// The separation between "path params" and "remaining params" is important
// because it determines what goes in the URL vs. what goes in the request body
// (for POST/PUT/PATCH) or query string (for GET/DELETE).
// =============================================================================

/**
 * Result of building a URL from a base, path template, and params.

 * @property remaining - Params that were NOT consumed by path param substitution.
 *   When `asQuery` is true, this is always empty (all remaining params went into
 *   the query string). When `asQuery` is false, these params are available for

 * empty baseUrl (same-origin usage) passes the path through untouched.

  // path, not in the middle of it. Concatenating instead (as this did before
  // 4.2.1) put the path inside the base's query VALUE:
  // 'https://api.test/v1?key=abc' + '/items' became '.../v1?key=abc/items',

  // This ACCUMULATES rather than overriding, which is the one way it differs
  // from `mergeHeaders` — that uses `set()`, so a per-call header replaces a
  // global one. Here a call param with a key the base already used produces
  // BOTH: `?key=abc&key=xyz`, and which one a server honours is its own
  // business (`searchParams.get` takes the first; PHP takes the last).
  //
  // Accumulating is deliberate: array params already serialize as repeated
  // keys, so `tags=a&tags=b` is a shape this function must preserve, and
  // de-duplicating by key would silently collapse it. The consequence is that
  // a base-level param cannot be overridden per call — put it in middleware

  // mid-string -- 'https://api.test/v1#f' + '/items' gave '.../v1#f/items',
  // which parses to pathname '/v1'. Diagnostic output that resolves to the
  // wrong endpoint is the same defect 4.2.1 removed from the request path.

/**
 * Substitutes `:param` tokens in the path with matching values from params,
 * optionally appends remaining params as a query string.
 *
 * This is the main URL construction function used by the request engine.
 * It handles the full lifecycle from path template to final URL.
 *
 * **Path param matching** uses regex with a word-boundary lookahead to prevent
 * partial matches. For example, a param key `id` will match `:id` but NOT
 * `:idExtra`. This is achieved by requiring that the character after the param
 * name is either a non-alphanumeric-underscore character or end of string.
 *
 * **Query string rules** (when `asQuery` is true):
 * - Primitives: `{ page: 1 }` → `?page=1`
 * - Arrays: repeated keys — `{ tags: ['a', 'b'] }` → `?tags=a&tags=b`
 * - null/undefined: silently omitted
 * - Nested objects: throws TypeError (must flatten before passing)
 *
 * @param baseUrl - API base URL (e.g., '/api' or 'https://api.example.com')
 * @param path - Path template with optional `:param` tokens (e.g., '/items/:id')
 * @param params - Key-value params to substitute and/or serialize
 * @param asQuery - If true, remaining (non-path) params are appended as query string.
 *   Defaults to false.
 * @returns The built URL and any remaining params not consumed by path or query
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Path param substitution
 * buildUrl('/api', '/items/:id', { id: '42', page: 1 })
 * // → { url: '/api/items/42', remaining: { page: 1 } }
 *
 * // With query string
 * buildUrl('/api', '/items', { page: 1, limit: 20 }, true)
 * // → { url: '/api/items?page=1&limit=20', remaining: {} }

  // uses: [a-zA-Z0-9_]+, matched greedily, so ':id' never matches inside
  // ':idExtra'. A repeated token ('/orgs/:id/members/:id') is substituted at
