//
// This file ships three ready-to-use middleware functions that cover the most
// common cross-cutting concerns for HTTP clients:
//
//   1. retryMiddleware — automatically retries failed requests on server errors
//   2. logMiddleware   — logs request/response lifecycle to the console
//   3. cacheMiddleware — caches successful responses in memory with TTL
//
// These are intentionally decoupled from the core library. They are optional
// utilities that consumers can import if they want them, but the core
// (`createApi`, `Request`, `composeMiddleware`) works perfectly without them.

/**
 * Resolves after `ms` milliseconds, or immediately if `signal` aborts first.

 * This never rejects. A whole-operation deadline (see `timeout` on
 * `RequestConfig`) must be able to cut a backoff sleep short without
 * threading an exception through a middleware that must not throw — so on
 * abort the promise simply resolves early, and the retry loop re-checks the
 * signal itself to decide whether to stop.
 *
 * The abort listener is removed on both paths — timer-elapsed and
 * abort-fired — so a long retry sequence does not accumulate one listener
 * per attempt on `ctx.request.signal` (the same class of leak fixed in
 * `anySignal` previously).

/**
 * Creates a middleware that retries failed requests with a real backoff
 * policy: exponential (or linear, or custom) delay curves, full jitter,
 * `Retry-After` support, a configurable retry predicate, and an observational
 * `onRetry` hook.
 *
 * **How it works:**
 *
 * When the downstream chain (via `next()`) returns a result that `retryOn`
 * accepts, this middleware waits out a delay and calls `next()` again —
 * re-executing every middleware below it in the onion plus the core fetch.
 * It keeps retrying until either the predicate rejects the result, or `max`
 * attempts have been exhausted.
 *
 * **Delay:**
 *
 * The base delay comes from the configured curve (`baseDelay * 2^(attempt-1)`
 * for `'exponential'`, `baseDelay * attempt` for `'linear'`, or a custom
 * function of the attempt number), capped by `maxDelay`. Full jitter then
 * applies: the actual delay is `Math.random() * computed`, per AWS's
 * recommendation for de-synchronising a thundering herd. A `Retry-After`
 * response header — when present and `respectRetryAfter` is not disabled —
 * replaces the computed delay outright (still capped by `maxDelay`) and is
 * honoured as-is, without jitter: a server telling you exactly when to come
 * back should not be randomised.
 *
 * **Abortable sleep:**
 *
 * The backoff sleep watches `ctx.request.signal`, so a whole-operation
 * `timeout` cannot be outlived by a long delay: the sleep resolves (rather
 * than rejects) as soon as the signal aborts, and the loop proceeds straight
 * to `next()`. With an already-aborted signal, the core fetch rejects
 * immediately (no network call), and its existing abort classification does
 * the rest — the result comes back with `kind: 'timeout'` for a deadline,
 * `kind: 'abort'` for a cancellation or a dedupe supersede — instead of this
 * middleware reporting a stale HTTP result for a request that was actually
 * cancelled or timed out. The loop then exits on its own, since an abort is
 * status 0 and the default `retryOn` only matches `status >= 500`.
 *
 * **What it does NOT retry by default:**
 *
 * - 4xx errors — caused by the request itself, not transient server issues.
 * - 429 and network errors (status 0) — deliberately excluded from the
 *   default so upgrading doesn't change behaviour under you; pass a custom
 *   `retryOn` to opt in.
 *
 * **Retry count semantics:**
 *
 * `max` is the number of ADDITIONAL attempts after the initial one. So
 * `retryMiddleware(2)` (or `{ max: 2 }`) means: 1 initial attempt + up to 2
 * retries = 3 total calls to `next()` in the worst case.
 *
 * **Middleware position matters:**
 *
 * Because `next()` re-executes everything downstream, placing retry
 * middleware BEFORE auth middleware means auth headers will be re-injected
 * on each retry (good). Placing it AFTER means the same headers are reused
 * (usually fine, but stale tokens won't be refreshed).
 *
 * @param options - Either a number (shorthand for `{ max: number }`, kept for
 *   backwards compatibility) or a {@link RetryOptions} object. Defaults to 3.
 * @returns A Middleware function that can be passed to `createApi` or
 *   individual `Request` configs.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Retry up to 2 times on server errors (3 total attempts), numeric shorthand
 * const api = createApi({
 *   baseUrl: '/api',
 *   requests: { getItems },
 *   middleware: [retryMiddleware(2)],
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Full policy: linear backoff, a higher cap, and progress reporting
 * const api = createApi({
 *   baseUrl: '/api',
 *   requests: { getItems },
 *   middleware: [retryMiddleware({
 *     max: 5,
 *     delay: 'linear',
 *     baseDelay: 200,
 *     maxDelay: 10_000,
 *     onRetry: ({ attempt, max, delay }) => console.log(`retry ${attempt}/${max} in ${delay}ms`),
 *   })],
 * })
 * ```

/**
 * Middleware that logs the lifecycle of each API request to the console.
 *
 * **What it logs:**
 *
 * 1. A "request start" line when the request begins, showing the HTTP method,
 *    the request name (e.g., 'getUser'), and the full URL.
 *
 * 2. A "request complete" line when the response arrives, showing:
 *    - The request name
 *    - Whether it succeeded ("OK") or failed ("ERROR" + status code)
 *    - The elapsed time in milliseconds
 *
 * **Timing:**
 *
 * Uses `Date.now()` instead of `performance.now()` for maximum runtime
 * compatibility. `performance.now()` is not available in all environments
 * (e.g., some edge runtimes, older Node.js versions), while `Date.now()`
 * works everywhere. The millisecond precision of `Date.now()` is more than
 * sufficient for HTTP request timing.
 *
 * **Output format examples:**
 *
 * ```
 * [liaise] → GET getItems /api/items
 * [liaise] ← getItems OK (142ms)
 *
 * [liaise] → POST createUser /api/users
 * [liaise] ← createUser ERROR 422 (89ms)
 * ```
 *
 * **Options:**
 *
 * Use it bare, or call it with `{ enabled, data }`: `logMiddleware({ data: true })`
 * also prints each call's data (`console.table` for objects and arrays,
 * `console.log` otherwise, `error.body` on failure). `enabled: false` makes it
 * a pass-through. A call that joined a shared request is tagged `, shared`.
 * The client-level `log` option prints the same lines, but is not a
 * middleware: it wraps the whole call, so it also logs a call the timeout
 * backstop ends while a middleware is stuck.
 *
 * **Usage note:**
 *
 * This middleware is intended for development and debugging. In production,
 * you may want to replace it with a custom middleware that sends telemetry
 * to your observability platform instead of logging to the console.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { logMiddleware } from 'liaise/middleware'
 *
 * const api = createApi({
 *   baseUrl: '/api',
 *   requests: { getItems, createUser },
 *   middleware: [logMiddleware], // or logMiddleware({ data: true })
 * })
 * ```

/**
 * Creates a middleware that caches successful responses in memory, keyed by
 * request name and params. Identical calls within the TTL window are served
 * from cache without hitting the network.
 *
 * **Cache key:**
 *
 * The key is `ctx.requestName` plus `stableKey(ctx.request.params)` — a
 * content-based key (see `src/utils/stable-key.ts`): object keys sorted,
 * `undefined` members dropped, `Date` by its ISO string, `Map`, `Set` and
 * typed arrays by their entries. It is derived from the original params
 * object, not the processed URL.
 *
 * A call whose params cannot be keyed soundly — a BigInt, an `ArrayBuffer`,
 * `Blob`, `FormData` or `URLSearchParams`, a circular structure, or an object
 * with no enumerable state, at any depth — is never cached and never served
 * from cache. Declining is always safe; serving one caller the response to a
 * different payload never is. A raw string keys fine and is cached normally.
 *
 * **What is cached:**
 *
 * Only successful results are stored. If the response has an error (4xx, 5xx,
 * network error, or GraphQL error), the result is not cached and the next call
 * will hit the network again.
 *
 * The full `Result` object is cached, including `response` (headers, status)
 * and `retry`. Calling `retry()` on a cached result re-enters the middleware
 * chain — if the TTL is still valid it returns the cached value; if expired,
 * it makes a fresh network call. To force a network call on a specific
 * invocation, use `skipMiddleware: [myCache]` in the call options.
 *
 * **Isolation:**
 *
 * Each call to `cacheMiddleware()` creates an independent store. Two separate
 * instances on two different endpoints never share entries, regardless of
 * request name or params shape.
 *
 * **Eviction:**
 *
 * When the store reaches `maxSize`, the oldest entry by insertion time is
 * evicted before the new one is added. Expired entries are removed on access
 * rather than on a background timer.
 *
 * **Debugging:**
 *
 * Set `debug: true` to log cache hits and misses to the console:
 * ```
 * [liaise cache] HIT  getUser {"id":"42"}
 * [liaise cache] MISS getUser {"id":"42"}
 * ```
 *
 * @param options.ttl - Time-to-live in milliseconds. Defaults to 5 minutes.
 * @param options.maxSize - Maximum number of entries. Defaults to 50.
 * @param options.debug - Log hits and misses to console. Defaults to false.
 * @returns A middleware function with an attached `clear()` method.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { cacheMiddleware } from 'liaise/middleware'
 *
 * const getUserCache = cacheMiddleware({ ttl: 5 * 60_000, maxSize: 100 })
 *
 * const getUser = new Request<{ id: string }, User>({
 *   method: 'GET',
 *   path: '/users/:id',
 *   middleware: [getUserCache],
 * })
 *
 * // Force a network call for a single invocation:
 * const { data } = await api.getUser({ id: '42' }, { skipMiddleware: [getUserCache] })
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Clear all cached entries on logout so the next user gets fresh data:
