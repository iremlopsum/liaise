 * The params a path template requires, as `{ token: string | number }`.

 * `string | number` because `buildUrl` does `encodeURIComponent(String(value))`
 * — a numeric id is as valid as a string one. An object is rejected, which is
 * right: `String({})` is `"[object Object]"`, a silently wrong URL.
 *
 * A path with no tokens gives `{}`, and `Record<string, never> extends {}`
 * holds, so `ApiMethod`'s optional-params branch still fires and `api.health()`
 * stays callable with no arguments.
 *
 * A token must BEGIN a path segment, mirroring `buildUrl`'s Phase 1 fill and
 * its Phase 1b check (src/utils/path-params.ts, search "A token must BEGIN a
 * path segment"): matching is anchored to `/:` rather than a bare `:`, so a
 * colon that appears mid-segment — a Google-style custom method like
 * `/v1/documents:batchGet`, or a time like `/events/at/12:30` — is never
 * mistaken for a token. Both of those paths parse to `{}`, not
 * `{ batchGet: ... }` or `{ '30': ... }`, and `buildUrl` sends them as written.
 *
 * Until 5.2.1 that was true of the type and of Phase 1b but not of the fill,
 * which substituted a `:name` anywhere: `/v1/documents:batchGet` with
 * `{ batchGet: 'yes' }` built `/v1/documentsyes`. The fill is anchored now,
 * and a mid-segment `:name` that a param names is refused at runtime rather
 * than sent as text with the value moved elsewhere. A `:name` after `?`, `&`
 * or `=` in the query string is refused as well, here by `QueryTokenGuard`.
 *
 * A missing leading slash is normalised before anchoring. `buildUrl` requires a
 * token to sit at index 0 of a `split('/')` segment, which means "preceded by
 * `/`, **or at the very start of the string**" — and segment 0 always starts at
 * index 0. Prepending `/` when it is absent makes this type's `/:` requirement
 * exactly equivalent to that condition, and is a no-op for a path that already
 * has one.
 *
 * 4.1.0 shipped the anchor without the normalisation and so under-inferred a
 * path whose token *starts the string*: `':id'` inferred nothing while the
 * request still demanded `id`, failing at runtime. A path like `'users/:id'`
 * was never affected — it contains a literal `/:`.
 *
 * Exported for `tests/types.test-d.ts`. Not re-exported from `src/index.ts`, so
 * it is not public API — see index.ts's note on what is deliberately withheld.

 *
 * **Fires only on a literal.** `string extends `${string}#${string}`` is false,

 * for the same reason. A config assembled at runtime cannot be checked at
 * compile time, and refusing it would make the factory unusable for that shape.
 *
 * `new Request` gets no equivalent: it takes no path literal, so there is
 * nothing for a guard to read. That is the asymmetry §3.4 already accepted, and

 * `path` would intersect to `never` and make TypeScript report a mismatch on

/**

 *
 * Two sources of truth that can disagree is a mistake, and this project makes a
 * contradiction unrepresentable rather than picking a winner silently — the same
 * reasoning as the `share` + `dedupe` throw and the empty-body guard.
 *
 * It fires even when the two AGREE, because the failure it prevents is temporal:
 * the schema changes, the explicit type is now wrong, and nothing reports it
 * because it was never being read.
 *
 * `unknown extends TResponse` is true only when no explicit argument was given,
 * which is what makes "was one supplied?" answerable at all. `any` satisfies it
 * too and counts as "not given" — acceptable, since `defineRequest<any>()` is
 * already opting out of everything.
 *
 * The "was a schema given?" side reads `SchemaOut<TSchema>` — the schema's
 * OUTPUT — rather than asking whether `TSchema` itself is `undefined`, and the
 * config field feeding it is `Omit<RequestConfig, 'schema'> & { schema?:
 * TSchema }` rather than `RequestConfig & { schema?: TSchema }`. Both changes
 * exist for the same reason: `RequestConfig` already declares `schema?:
 * StandardSchemaV1<unknown>` (for `new Request`), so a config typed as plain
 * `RequestConfig` — or a spread of one — structurally carries that field
 * whether or not a schema was actually written. Left in the intersection, that
 * field becomes a second, competing inference source for `TSchema`, and —
 * only when `TSchema` also appears inside a conditional in the SAME parameter,
 * which is what a "was one given?" guard requires — TypeScript stops
 * decomposing a non-literal argument (a bare `RequestConfig`-typed variable)
 * property by property and falls back to `TSchema`'s default instead, which
 * then disagrees with the very shape it just failed to read. `Omit` removes
 * the competing source; reading the OUTPUT instead of `TSchema` itself
 * survives whatever that source infers anyway, because an unknown-output
 * schema (the widened `StandardSchemaV1<unknown>`, same as a plain
 * `undefined`) reads as "not given" right alongside the real absence.
 *
 * A schema carrying no type information — an OUTPUT of `unknown` or `any` —
 * is treated as no schema at all: the explicit response type is HONOURED, and
 * no conflict is raised. `defineRequest<User>()({ ..., schema:
 * looselyTypedSchema })` compiles and its `data` is `User`, not `unknown`.
 * This is not a gap being tolerated; it is what makes a widened
 * `RequestConfig`-typed config work at all — a spread of one carries exactly
 * `schema?: StandardSchemaV1<unknown>`, inherited from `RequestConfig` itself,
 * and a schema written directly can be just as loosely typed. A schema that
 * DOES carry type information — a concrete `Output` — supplies the response
 * type instead (see `defineRequest`'s return-type expression), and an
 * explicit type alongside THAT is the conflict this guard exists to catch.
 *
 * This falls out of `SchemaOut` for free, and only BECAUSE the guard and
 * `defineRequest`'s return type read it identically. That took two attempts:
 * moving the guard onto `SchemaOut` (the OUTPUT paragraph above) fixed the
 * guard's own over-rejection of widened configs, but the return type was left
 * reading `[TSchema] extends [undefined]` directly — the schema's PRESENCE,
 * not its output — so a widened config now passed the guard while the return
 * type still discarded its `TResponse`. Same mistake as the original
 * over-rejection, just relocated: two formulas answering one question. Both
 * disappeared once both sites read `SchemaOut`. Do not let them drift apart
 * again: change `SchemaConflictGuard` and `defineRequest`'s return-type
 * expression together, and reverify against `tests/types.test-d.ts`'s
 * widened-config assertions, which check the resulting `data` type via
 * `createApi` rather than merely that the call compiles — editing one site
 * without the other, unverified, is exactly how this regressed.
